# Intellectual Property & Licensing Framework

## 1. Ownership of the Soma
The **EmergentDNA DAO** (the Collective) holds the exclusive right to the "Sovereign Soma" protocol, including the MQTT message maps, the specific hardware configuration, and the "EmergentDNA" brand.

## 2. Artist Retained Rights
Individual Founding Artists retain the full copyright to their specific parametric inputs (e.g., the specific audio algorithms for the Larynx or visual patterns for the Skin). 
*   Artists grant the DAO a **perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide license** to use these inputs as part of the EmergentDNA organism.

## 3. On-Chain Provenance (Snapshots)
All "State-Snapshots" minted by the Brain Node are owned by the DAO Treasury. 
*   Proceeds from the sale of these snapshots are directed to the Gnosis Safe.
*   The metadata of each snapshot shall credit the Architects active during that specific life-phase.

## 4. Open Source vs. Proprietary
The "Reflex System" (safety code) is Open Source (MIT License). The "DNA Logic" (the AI and behavioral parameters) is proprietary to the Collective to prevent unauthorized cloning of the Soma.
