# Intellectual Property & Licensing Framework

## 1. Ownership of the Soma
The **EmergentDNA DAO** (the Collective) holds the exclusive right to the "Sovereign Soma" protocol. This includes the specific MQTT message maps, the integrated hardware configuration, the "EmergentDNA" brand identity, and the collective behavioral logic of the organism.

## 2. Artist Retained Rights
Individual Founding Artists retain the full copyright and ownership of their specific parametric inputs and unique algorithms (e.g., the specific generative audio code for the Larynx or visual shaders for the Skin). 
*   **Grant of License:** Artists grant the DAO a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, execute, and display these inputs as an integral part of the EmergentDNA organism.

## 3. On-Chain Provenance (Snapshots)
All "State-Snapshots" minted by the Brain Node are the property of the DAO Treasury. 
*   **Revenue:** Proceeds from the primary sale and secondary royalties of these snapshots are directed to the **Gnosis Safe**.
*   **Attribution:** The metadata of each snapshot shall credit the Architects active during that specific life-phase, ensuring permanent on-chain provenance for the contributors.

## 4. Open Source vs. Proprietary Logic
To balance transparency with the security of the organism:
*   **The Reflex System:** Safety code and basic hardware drivers are Open Source (MIT License) to encourage safety standards in kinetic art.
*   **The DNA Logic:** The core AI, behavioral parameters, and "Adrenaline" triggers are proprietary to the Collective to prevent unauthorized cloning or "forking" of the Sovereign Soma.

## 5. Commercial Licensing & Exhibitions
5.1 **Exhibition Rights:** The DAO may vote to "rent" or license the physical Soma to museums, galleries, or festivals.
5.2 **Execution:** The Lead Architect is authorized to execute commercial contracts on behalf of the DAO following a successful Quorum vote as defined in the Bylaws.
5.3 **Proceeds:** All commercial fees shall be deposited into the Gnosis Safe for maintenance and Architect distributions.
