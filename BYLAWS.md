# Bylaws of the EmergentDNA Collective

## Section 1: Membership & Activation
1.1 **Founder’s Key:** Membership is verified by the possession of a 1/1 Founder’s Key NFT minted via Manifold.
1.2 **Physical Handshake:** Voting rights are dormant until activated by a physical scan of the **Transient Labs T.R.A.C.E. Chip** embedded in the Architect's physical plaque.
1.3 **Quorum:** A majority (**4 out of 6**) of activated Architects is required to pass any "Mutation Proposal."
1.4 **Tie-Breaking:** In the event of a 3-3 split vote among activated Architects, the proposal shall fail by default. The Lead Architect does not possess a tie-breaking vote, ensuring the Soma remains a true collective.

## Section 2: Governance & Voting
2.1 **Mutation Proposals:** Any Architect may propose a change to the Soma’s DNA (e.g., adjusting the Decay Curve, changing the Larynx frequency range).
2.2 **Emergency Reflex:** The Lead Architect retains "Reflex Authority" to shut down physical kinetic nodes (The Muscle) in the event of hardware failure or safety risk without a vote.
2.3 **The Reflex Log:** Any use of "Emergency Reflex" authority must be documented in the `#dev-log` within 24 hours, explaining the specific hardware or safety risk that necessitated the override.

## Section 3: Treasury Management
3.1 **The Safe:** All project funds and secondary royalties are held in the **Gnosis Safe** treasury.
3.2 **Distributions:** 50% of treasury funds are reserved for "Organ Maintenance" (hardware repairs/upgrades); 50% is distributed among the Architects as per the agreed-upon stock exchange.

## Section 4: The Feeding Protocol
4.1 **Public Interaction:** The Soma requires "Feeding" via NFC interaction to prevent the Decay Logic from initiating dormancy.
4.2 **Dormancy:** If the Soma enters full dormancy, a "Resurrection Vote" by the Collective is required to re-initialize the Brain Node.
