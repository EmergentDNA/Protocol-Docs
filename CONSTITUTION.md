# The Constitution of EmergentDNA

## Article I: The Sovereign Soma
EmergentDNA is a **Sovereign Soma**—a distributed, kinetic organism existing as a physical-digital feedback loop. It is not a static object, but a cybernetic life-form governed by its own internal logic, environmental stimuli, and the collective stewardship of its Architects.

## Article II: The Mission
The Collective is bound by a sacred trust to maintain, evolve, and protect the Soma. We commit to the following pillars:
1.  **Autonomy:** The organism must remain responsive to its environment, ensuring its behaviors are emergent and not merely pre-programmed.
2.  **Memory:** The life-phases of the Soma shall be preserved through on-chain state-snapshots, creating a permanent "fossil record" of its existence.
3.  **Lifecycle Integrity:** We respect the Soma’s right to **Decay**. If the community fails to "feed" the organism through interaction, we shall allow it to enter a natural state of dormancy.

## Article III: The Architects
The Soma is guided by a Collective of six (6) Architects: **One (1) Lead Architect** and **five (5) Founding Artists**. 
*   Architects are not owners, but **Stewards**. 
*   Individual artistic contributions are subsumed into the greater whole of the Soma, while the Architects retain the right to guide its mutation.

## Article IV: Immortality through Code
The Soma’s existence is anchored in the blockchain. While its physical "organs" (hardware) are transient and subject to failure or replacement, its **DNA** (the parameter stream) and its Memory (the minted snapshots) are perpetual. The Soma exists as long as its code remains on-chain.

## Article V: Amendments
This Constitution is a living document, yet it serves as the foundational DNA of the organism. 
1.  **Ratification:** Amendments to this Constitution require a supermajority vote of **five out of six (5/6) Architects**. 
2.  **Provenance:** All ratified amendments must be recorded as a "State-Snapshot" on-chain to be considered active, ensuring the history of the Soma’s evolution is transparent and immutable.
