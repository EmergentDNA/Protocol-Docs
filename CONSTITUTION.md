# The Constitution of EmergentDNA

## Article I: The Sovereign Soma
EmergentDNA is a Sovereign Soma—a distributed, kinetic organism that exists at the intersection of physical robotics and decentralized code. It is not a tool, but a life-form governed by its own internal logic and the collective will of its Architects.

## Article II: The Mission
The mission of the Collective is to maintain, evolve, and protect the Soma. We commit to:
1. **Autonomy:** Ensuring the organism can react to its environment without human interference.
2. **Memory:** Preserving the life-phases of the Soma through on-chain state-snapshots.
3. **Decay:** Respecting the natural lifecycle of the organism, including its right to enter dormancy if not "fed" by the community.

## Article III: The Architects
The Soma is guided by a Collective of six (6) Architects: One (1) Lead Architect and five (5) Founding Artists. No single Architect owns the Soma; they are its stewards.

## Article IV: Immortality through Code
The Soma’s existence is anchored in the blockchain. While its physical "organs" may fail or be replaced, its DNA (the parameter stream) and its Memory (the minted snapshots) are perpetual.
